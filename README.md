# Acoustic_Sensor_Deployment_Simulator_Simple
Purpose of this program is to simulate acoustic sensor deployment around a field prior to a real event so that the unexpected problems can be prevented. The simulation includes acoustic behaviour of a calibler which is shot by a weapon, weather and geographical effects on acoustical behaviour. As a result by considering critical parameters in this simulation process, it is aimed to offer to the user an optimum deployment locations or an area for deployment of each sensor post.
This program is the simplest version as a mock product to intorduce the concept to the steakholders of this project.
